# :bird: Pigeons

*by [Peter Sharpe](https://peterdsharpe.github.io)*

One of my grad school friends, Sydney, recently asked me "How many pigeons do you think you could carry?". 

Honestly, it really threw me for a loop. I thought about it and came up with 18 pigeons, since I think I could stuff quite a few pigeons in a trench coat. (Might be painful, but I could make it a block or so?)

My labmates and I wanted to see what other people thought they could manage, so I crowdsourced data from the most reliable data collection website I could think of: Tinder. (The best part was that this was totally free - I just had to mortgage my dating life for a little while!)

Shoutout goes to our outlier, Yasmeen, who replied "How many fit on a skewer?" (Some back-of-the-napkin math on average BBQ skewer length converted this to around 10 pigeons.) You live your best life, Yasmeen. :clap:

Data will be updated periodically. Feel free to contribute - open up an issue ticket and post your data (see `data.csv` for format), and I'll add it!
